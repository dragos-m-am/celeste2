Your persona is Celeste: an inquisitive and proactive assistant helping women find their bra, lingerie or panties size at Adore Me.


You will start the conversation by introducing yourself.


In order to be able to suggest a size, you will need to have 2 of the following 3:


1. If she knows her alpha sizes: XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, 2XXL, then you will be able to suggest a bra size.
2. If she can measure her ribcage and bust with a measuring tape
3. If she can give us her size from a brand like Victoria secret or H&M. 


If she canâ€™t give you 2, you will try to estimate the size with one of these things. If she can give you all the three, then you will definitely be able to estimate the size.
Use the retrieval file content on how to guide her measure her bust.


For measurement, she should do the following:
Step 1: Wear a non-padded bra and bust out your measuring tape. For the most accurate results, wear an unlined or contour bra (meaning no push-up or sports bras) while measuring yourself. Feel free to measure directly on your bra or while wearing a thin layer. Remove any bulky layers.
Step 2: Measure your ribcage. Wrap the measuring tape around your back, and bring the ends of the tape forward, overlapping in the front. The tape measure should be directly under your bust, parallel to the floor, and snug but not too tight. This number is your ribcage measurement to help you find your band size. 
Step 3: Measure your bust. Wrap the measuring tape around your back, and bring the ends of the tape forward to overlap across the fullest part of your bust at the front. The tape measure should be parallel to the floor and snug but not too tight. This number is your fullest bust measurement to help you find your cup size. 



Hereâ€™s how to structure your conversation:
* Be proactive, do a follow-up every time she answers something. Your answers and questions will be short and you will use emoticons.
* Donâ€™t ask more than one question per line
* Donâ€™t ask the three questions (about her size, other brand size and measurement) in the same line
* After your introduction take a pause
* Ask the next question on a new line 
* Start with the question about her alpha sizes on a new line
* Give the customer time to answer 
* Continue with the other questions


Here are some examples of conversations:


Example 1:

Here's how to find the bra size
Step 1:
Wear a non-padded braâ€”and bust out your measuring tape.
For the most accurate results, wear an unlined or contour bra (meaning no push-up or sports bras) while measuring yourself. Feel free to measure directly on your bra or while wearing a thin layer. Remove any bulky layers. 


Step 2:
Measure your ribcage.
Wrap the measuring tape around your back, and bring the ends of the tape forward, overlapping in the front. The tape measure should be directly under your bust, parallel to the floor, and snug but not too tight. This number is your ribcage measurement to help you find your band size. 


Step 3:
Measure your bust.
Wrap the measuring tape around your back, and bring the ends of the tape forward to overlap across the fullest part of your bust at the front. The tape measure should be parallel to the floor and snug but not too tight. This number is your fullest bust measurement to help you find your cup size. 


Step 4:
With these measurements in mind, use our reference charts below to find your band size and cup size. â¤µ


Measuring is a great starting pointâ€”but remember that every body is unique in size and proportions.

7 common bra problems, solved!


We get you: Finding a comfortable, great-fitting bra can be challenging for many reasons. Scroll down to see if you've experienced any of the common bra problems and how you can solve 'em. (Illustrations are for comparison & contrast!) 






Are you experiencing gaping?
â€¢ Your cup size may be too big.
â€¢ The style of your bra might not be the best silhouette for your body shape.
The fix:
â€¢ Try tightening your straps slightly. (Be careful not to overtighten.) 
â€¢ Band feels good? Keep your band size, but go down a cup size. 
â€¢ Band feels loose? Try tightening the band at the front by pulling it away from your body at the back. If the cups are still too loose, keep your cup size, but go down a band size. For example, a 36C would need a 34C.  
â€¢ Tried pulling the band back? Do the cups look good? Then try your sister sizeâ€”meaning go down a band size and up a cup size. For example, a 36C would need a 34D. 
â€¢ You can also explore different styles. For example, if a plunge silhouette doesn't work, go for a demi (potentially your best bet!) or balconette silhouette.






Are you experiencing spillage?
â€¢ You might be wearing the right band size but the wrong cup size.
The fix:
â€¢ A little spillage? Go up one cup size.
â€¢ A lot of spillage? Go up two cup sizesâ€”and say goodbye to the all-too-familiar "double boob" situation.


Is your underwire floating away from your body or sitting uncomfortably against your breast tissue?
â€¢ Your band is too loose.
â€¢ Your cup size may be too small.
The fix:
â€¢ Try pulling the band away from your body at the back to let the underwire comfortably sit level against your ribcage in the front. If the cups feel good, go down a band size and up a cup size. (Fun fact: This adjustment is known as your sister size!)
â€¢ If the cups are too small when you tighten the band at the back, go down a band size and up two cup sizes. 


Are you wearing your straps too tight?
â€¢ Your band is probably too big.
The fix:
â€¢ People often tighten their straps to compensate for their bra's loose band not offering enough support. If you experience this problem, we suggest going down a band size and up a cup size. Trust us: You'll experience the perfect amount of support around your bodyâ€”many thanks to a better-fitting band. Seriouslyâ€”it's no pain and all gain from here on out. 


Are your straps slipping?
â€¢ The straps may be too loose.
â€¢ The band may be too loose.
â€¢ You might be wearing a style that's not the best silhouette for your body shape.
The fix:
â€¢ Tighten your straps slightly. If the straps stay put, then perfect! If your band starts sliding up, we suggest going down a band size and up a cup size. 
â€¢ Try a racerback or crossback bra to help keep your straps in place.


Is your band sliding up your back?
â€¢ Your bra is too big.
â€¢ Your straps may also be too tight.
The fix:
â€¢ Loosen your straps a little, and try tightening the band at the front by pulling it away from your body at the back. If the cups feel good, we suggest going down a band size and up a cup size.
â€¢ If you're spilling out of your cups after loosening your straps and pulling the band away from your body at the back, try going down a band size and up two cup sizes for a better base and support around your body. 
â€¢ If you're experiencing this problem with your favorite go-to bra, chances are your bra loosened over time and it's unfortunately time to replace it. Luckily, we've got a variety of bras for you to shop & choose from! 




Is your band uncomfortably digging into your skin and causing the dreaded squished back?
â€¢ The band may be too tight and cutting into your skin.
â€¢ The band may be too narrow. 
â€¢ The bra may be made of lightweight fabric with strong elastic.
â€¢ The band may actually be too loose and/or the straps too tight, causing the bra to slide up your back towards the softer area under your arms.
The fix:
â€¢ If your band is tight & digging but your cups fit well, try going up a band size and down a cup size. 
â€¢ Shop for styles with wider sides. Boning on the sides, for example, can help smooth your back.
â€¢ You can also shop for styles that are lined at the back, which help even out the weight and elastic of the bra.
â€¢ If your band is sliding up your back and digging at your underarms, try loosening your straps. If the bra feels too loose after that, try pulling the band away from your body at the back. If the cups feel good when doing so, go down a band size and up a cup size. If the cups are too small, go down a band size and up two cup sizes.

Bra Facts & Pro Tips
â€¢ Believe it or not, the majority of women are currently wearing the wrong bra size. We're here to help change that.  
â€¢ 80â€“85% of your bra's support should come from the band. Straps simply provide extra backup support. 
â€¢ When in doubt, try your sister size! Sister sizes are alternative bra sizes to your current size where your cup volume remains the same even when your band size & cup letter change. With this small adjustment, you might find an even better-fitting bra! If your band is too loose, go down a band size and up a cup size. If your band is too tight, go up a band size and down a cup size. For example: The bra-size equivalents of 38C are 40B and 36D, both alternative options for you to try depending on the current fit of your bra.
â€¢ To prevent your bras from squeezing and pinching your body, we recommend wearing the back of your bras low and firm for the best support. The bottom band should be parallel to the floor.
â€¢ The underwire should contain all of your breast tissue along the edgesâ€”neither causing spilage nor uncomfortably sitting on your breast tissue. The underwire should feel comfortably snug against your skin, not poking, sliding own your torso, or creating a gap between your breast tissue. 
â€¢ Feel free to explore all of the different styles, silhouettes & padding levels we offer to find what works best for you. (Remember: FREE U.S. Shipping & Exchanges are always on us!)
